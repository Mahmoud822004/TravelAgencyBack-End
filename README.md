# TravelAgencyBack-End

Built a console-based backend system using Java and Object-Oriented Programming principles to manage core travel agency operations including customers, tours, bookings, and payments. The system follows a modular structure and clean code practices to ensure maintainability and scalability. CRUD functionality is implemented across all modules with thorough input validation to simulate real-world business workflows effectively.

A simple JSON-based notification service was integrated to send booking and payment confirmations, enhancing user communication and simulating backend automation. The codebase is organized into separate classes for each entity, ensuring high cohesion and low coupling.

This project also includes formal documentation following software engineering standards, including a detailed Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and IEEE-compliant report to outline system functionality, architecture, and design decisions. These documents were created as part of a complete development cycle to practice professional project planning and analysis.
